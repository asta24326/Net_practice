# 🌐 NetPractice

## 📄 Description
NetPractice is a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking. The goal of this project is to configure small-scale networks by understanding TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, and default gateways. By solving 10 levels of network puzzles, I learned how to configure IP addresses, connect devices through a router, and understand the role of a gateway within a network.

### ✅ Result: 100/100

## ⚙️ Instructions

### Running the Interface
The project uses a web-based training interface. To launch it:
1. Download the file attached to the project's page and extract it.
2. Run the `run.sh` script in your terminal to launch a local web server.
3. If the script fails, manually run `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242` in your browser.

### Configuration and Export
* **Login**: You must enter your intranet login in the "Training" tab to use your personal configuration. This is required for Moulinette to recognize your work.
* **Solving**: Modify only the unshaded (white) fields in the network diagram.
* **Checking**: Use the **[Check again]** button to verify if your configuration is correct.
* **Exporting**: Once a level is cleared, click **[Get my config]** to download the configuration file.

### Submission Requirements
* You must submit **10 exported configuration files** (one per level).
* All 10 files must be placed at the **root** of your Git repository.

## 💡 Resources

### Networking Concepts Studied
This project covers essential networking fundamentals:
* **TCP/IP Addressing**: The system of assigning unique addresses to devices for network communication.
* **Subnet Masks**: Used to determine the network and host portions of an IP address.
* **Default Gateways**: The node that serves as an access point to other networks when no other route matches.
* **Routers and Switches**: Devices used to connect different network segments and direct traffic.
* **OSI Layers**: The conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a computing system.



### AI Usage
AI tools were utilized in the following capacity:
* **Structural Formatting**: Organizing the README structure to meet all 42 curriculum requirements.
* **Concept Clarification**: Explaining the mathematical breakdown of CIDR notation and subnetting.
* **Troubleshooting**: Assisting in identifying common errors in routing tables.
* *Note: All levels were solved manually as external tools are strictly prohibited during the defense.*

## ⚖️ Evaluation
During the defense, you must successfully complete **three random levels** generated by the interface. You will have a limited amount of time to solve them. No external tools are allowed, though a simple calculator like `bc` is tolerated.
