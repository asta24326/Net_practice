# 🌐 NetPractice

## 📄 Description
[cite_start]NetPractice is a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking[cite: 14]. [cite_start]The goal of this project is to configure small-scale networks by understanding TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, and default gateways[cite: 67]. [cite_start]By solving 10 levels of network puzzles, I learned how to connect devices through routers and manage network communication within a gateway[cite: 15, 68].

## ⚙️ Instructions

### Running the Interface
[cite_start]To run the training interface, follow these steps[cite: 76, 78]:
1. [cite_start]Download and extract the project files attached to the project's page[cite: 76, 77].
2. [cite_start]Execute the `run.sh` script in your terminal to launch a local web server and open the interface in your browser[cite: 78].
3. [cite_start]If `run.sh` fails, manually run the command `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242`[cite: 93].

### Configuration and Export
* [cite_start]**Login**: You must enter your intranet login in the "Training" tab to use your personal configuration[cite: 95, 171].
* [cite_start]**Solving**: Modify the unshaded fields in the network diagram until the network functions properly according to the objectives[cite: 136, 153].
* [cite_start]**Exporting**: After completing each level, use the **[Get my config]** button to download your configuration file[cite: 139, 172].

### Submission Requirements
* [cite_start]You must submit **10 exported configuration files** (one per level)[cite: 164, 170].
* [cite_start]These files must be placed at the **root** of your Git repository[cite: 164, 171].

## 💡 Resources

### Networking Concepts Studied
[cite_start]This project required an understanding of the following key concepts[cite: 163]:
* [cite_start]**TCP/IP Addressing**: Principles of assigning unique addresses to network nodes[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Subnet Masks**: Defining the network and host portions of an IP address[cite: 67, 154].
* [cite_start]**Default Gateways**: Identifying the exit point for traffic heading to external networks[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Routers and Switches**: Understanding how devices connect and route packets between different networks[cite: 154].
* [cite_start]**OSI Layers**: The conceptual framework for application communication over a network[cite: 163].



### AI Usage
[cite_start]AI tools were used during this project for the following tasks[cite: 161]:
* [cite_start]**Structural Formatting**: Using AI to organize the README according to the specific 42 curriculum requirements[cite: 161].
* [cite_start]**Technical Explanations**: Clarifying the logic behind subnet mask calculations and CIDR notation[cite: 161].
* [cite_start]**Documentation Review**: Ensuring the clarity and accuracy of the instructions provided[cite: 161].
* [cite_start]*Note: All networking levels were solved manually as external tools are prohibited during the final evaluation[cite: 176].*

## ⚖️ Evaluation
[cite_start]During the defense, you must successfully complete **three random levels** within a limited amount of time[cite: 174, 175]. [cite_start]No external tools are allowed, except for a simple calculator like `bc`[cite: 176, 177].
